# SeradexTool
For use by Lauretano Sign Group LLC. by Christopher Gergler 

Developed a system to access the Seradex database to collect information on various parts of signage sales.
While this won't work without the database, it does have the functionality to pull info from the database and populate columns in close similarity to the original software.
