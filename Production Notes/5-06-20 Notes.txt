Query for

SELECT [EstimateID], [LineNo], [ItemNo], [QtyOrdered], [ListPrice], [UnitPrice], [DiscountPct],	[DiscountAmt],[NetPrice] FROM [dbo].[EstimateDetails] WHERE [EstimateID] = XXXXX;

XXXX is the estimate ID pulled from the Estimate number. Two part query pass, First from dbo.Estimate, then from dbo.EstimateDetails.

Estimate Details uses the item numbers matched to the estimate ID.
Estimate ID is unique in the Estimates Table, but non-unique to the Estimate Details table.

Use this to populate the Details box below. From there repeat that action if possible for unique details. It should be shown in the description just as is.
